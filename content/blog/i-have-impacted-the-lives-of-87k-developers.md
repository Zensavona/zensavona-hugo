<p><p>I was looking at my StackOverflow profile the other day and saw something that made me stop and think for a second:</p>

<p><img src="https://zenidau.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/Jun/Screenshot_2015_06_26_20_36_16-1435497582888.png" alt="StackOverflow profile" /></p>

<p>I am by no means a high reputation user, or someone who participates in SO very often but wow, that number is absolutely mind bending to me.</p>

<p>What I understand this to mean is that eighty seven thousand developers have read the words I wrote after probably googling something related to a problem they've had. I don't think I've spoken to even one percent of that number of people face to face over the course of my entire life so far. It's nuts.</p>

<p>The funniest part is that most of the views my Qs and As have received are from questions about <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5346787/clearing-check-boxes-in-vb-net">.NET from my first semester of university</a> or my <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12830095/setting-http-headers-in-golang">first week of learning Go</a>. I guess we all get stuck on similar issues when we're starting out, before we go down our respective tech stack specialisation rabbit holes...</p>
