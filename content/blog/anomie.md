<p><blockquote>
  <p>Anomie is the condition of a society in which there are no clear rules, norms or standards of value.</p>

<p>In modern western society we seem to triumph diversity and inclusiveness over all else. I think this is misguided and wrong. </p>

<p>We need to draw a line here between demographic and moral diversity, demographic diversity (skin colour, age, sex, sexual orientation, etc.) is surely a good thing for the majority of the population; unfortunately we are not making this  distinction - our society, or at least the political left, promotes the idea that <em>everything</em> should be diverse and inclusive. </p>

<p>Once you make this distinction you see that nobody can coherently even <em>want</em> moral diversity - if you are for the issue of gay marriage, would you prefer there to be a great variety of opinions and no dominant one?</p>

<p>A happy society depends on people seeing the world the same way, and for people to see the world the same way they must share a morality. What this means in a practical sense is that allowing society to have pockets of various cultures, be them ethnographic, ideological or religious, goes against the ideal of fostering a sense of oneness in that society. A common morality and culture must be agreed upon and fostered by all, or it becomes easy to divide a group of people into hostile factions based on small differences.</p>

<p>Basically what Iâ€™m euphemising is that Islam, Christianity, (modern) Feminism and their siblings all have to go.</p></p>
