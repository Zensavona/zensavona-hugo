<p>In retrospect, this seems obvious - but I think all real realisations are that way, aren&#8217;t they?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been told by many people throughout my life to &#8220;only ever trust yourself&#8221; - I never really interpreted this correctly and as a result, thought it was some closed minded and shitty advice; turns out I was wrong.</p>

<h2 id='only_trusting_yourself_vs_trusting_yourself_to_judge_others'>Only trusting yourself vs. trusting yourself to judge others</h2>

<p>The really important differentiation here is between &#8220;only trusting yourself&#8221; (or more specifically, the implication of not trusting anyone else) and trusting your instincts (which I think is a much better way of putting this idea). Trusting your instincts is extremely important - sometimes they&#8217;re wrong, but most of the time they aren&#8217;t.</p>

<h2 id='if_you_feel_deep_down_that_you_can_entrust_your_life_to_a_person_trust_your_own_judgement'>If you feel deep down that you can entrust your life to a person, trust your own judgement.</h2>

<p>Sounds ludicrous right? But really, if you don’t think you can rely on your own <span>seemingly rash</span> judgement, how do you feel comfortable trusting anyone else’s judgement? It makes no sense. In the last 6 months or so I’ve rapidly become a much more confident person, much of this I attribute to trusting myself; there are more instances than I care to mention where I’ve acted upon someone else’s advice (in the past) in spite of my gut feeling being different, only to realise months (or years) later that I was right.</p>

<h2 id='trust_yourself_take_risks_and_own_your_failures'>Trust yourself, take risks and own your failures</h2>

<p>Sounds obvious and silly to the initiated, but I wish I had the sense to realise this a long time ago.</p>
